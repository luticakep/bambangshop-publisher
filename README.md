## About this Project
In this repository, we have provided you a REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API project using Rocket web framework.

This project consists of four modules:
1.  `controller`: this module contains handler functions used to receive request and send responses.
    In Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, this is the Controller part.
2.  `model`: this module contains structs that serve as data containers.
    In MVC pattern, this is the Model part.
3.  `service`: this module contains structs with business logic methods.
    In MVC pattern, this is also the Model part.
4.  `repository`: this module contains structs that serve as databases and methods to access the databases.
    You can use methods of the struct to get list of objects, or operating an object (create, read, update, delete).

This repository provides a basic functionality that makes BambangShop work: ability to create, read, and delete `Product`s.
This repository already contains a functioning `Product` model, repository, service, and controllers that you can try right away.

As this is an Observer Design Pattern tutorial repository, you need to implement another feature: `Notification`.
This feature will notify creation, promotion, and deletion of a product, to external subscribers that are interested of a certain product type.
The subscribers are another Rocket instances, so the notification will be sent using HTTP POST request to each subscriber's `receive notification` address.

## API Documentations

You can download the Postman Collection JSON here: https://ristek.link/AdvProgWeek7Postman

After you download the Postman Collection, you can try the endpoints inside "BambangShop Publisher" folder.
This Postman collection also contains endpoints that you need to implement later on (the `Notification` feature).

Postman is an installable client that you can use to test web endpoints using HTTP request.
You can also make automated functional testing scripts for REST API projects using this client.
You can install Postman via this website: https://www.postman.com/downloads/

## How to Run in Development Environment
1.  Set up environment variables first by creating `.env` file.
    Here is the example of `.env` file:
    ```bash
    APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL="http://localhost:8000"
    ```
    Here are the details of each environment variable:
    | variable              | type   | description                                                |
    |-----------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------|
    | APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL | string | URL address where this publisher instance can be accessed. |
2.  Use `cargo run` to run this app.
    (You might want to use `cargo check` if you only need to verify your work without running the app.)

## Your Reflections
This is the place for you to write reflections:

### Mandatory (Publisher) Reflections

#### Reflection Publisher-1
1. In this project, I think a single Model struct is enough. It is because the Subscriber struct is only used to store the subscriber's information, and the Notification struct is only used to store the notification's information. Therefore, it is not needed to create an interface or trait because we don't need a method that must be implemented by the Subscriber struct or the Notification struct.

2. Using DashMap is necessary because we need to access the data based on the id or url. DashMap is a map that can be accessed by multiple threads at the same time, so it is suitable for this case. If we use Vec, we need to iterate through the Vec to find the data we need, which is less efficient than DashMap.

3. We still need DashMap because the Singleton pattern is not enough to make the program thread-safe. The Singleton pattern only ensures that there is only one instance of a class, but it does not guarantee that the data inside the class is thread-safe. In this case, we need DashMap to ensure that the data inside the SUBSCRIBERS variable is thread-safe.

#### Reflection Publisher-2
1. By separating Service and Repository, we can separate the business logic from the data storage. The Service contains the business logic, while the Repository contains the data storage logic. This separation makes the code more modular and easier to maintain. If we put the business logic and data storage logic in the same class, it will violate the SRP because the class will have multiple reasons to change.

2. If we only use the Model, the code complexity for each model will increase. The Model will contain both the data storage logic and the business logic, which violates SRP in SOLID principles. The interactions between each model will also be more complex because the business logic and data storage logic are mixed in the Model. 

3. Postman is a very useful tool for testing APIs. It allows us to send HTTP requests to the server and see the response. Postman also provides a feature to save the requests and responses, so we can reuse them later. This feature is very helpful because we don't need to write the same request multiple times. We can also save the requests and responses in a collection, so we can organize them based on the project or the endpoint.
